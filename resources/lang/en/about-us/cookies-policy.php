                While some Internet browsers offer the “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to indicate to websites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked, these functions are not yet uniform, because in the technological field, as well as regulatory bodies have not adopted a common standard in this regard. By virtue of the foregoing, we are currently unable to respond to the DNT signals of browsers in regards to our website. The Company takes privacy and meaningful choices very seriously, and will do everything possible to continue monitoring the evolution of the DNT technology of the browser and the implementation of a standard.
