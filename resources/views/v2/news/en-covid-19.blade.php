    We know that due to the current situation, plans can change from time to time. This is why we have implemented policies that can help you plan your trip in the best way possible while protecting you from any unforeseen event.
</p>

<p><b>Flexible cancellation policy</b></p>

<p class="text-justify">
   Once your reservation is confirmed you can cancel or modify it without penalty up to 1 day prior to your arrival.

   All reservations either new or previously booked online through our website and which have a set date from April 10th through December 18th, 2020, may be canceled or modified up to 1 day prior to the check-in date without penalty charges. In case of canceling or later modifying it or not showing up, the corresponding penalty will apply.

<p class="text-justify">
   We have enabled a Rate Protection Policy that will allow you to move the dates of your stay to any available date from June 3rd , 2020 through December 20th, 2020, maintaining the same rate that you originally booked; thus, if plans change, do not worry of unforeseen additional expenses, your plans and your investment are protected.
